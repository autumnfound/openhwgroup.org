Episode 4 discusses the OpenHW Group philosophy of learn, adopt, produce: learning about what is available in open-source ecoysystems, adopting and gaining experience on using these building blocks and deploying commercial grade open-source elements in production releases of designs. The episode includes updates from the OpenHW Group HW Task Group discussing the CORE-V MCU SoC project and features speakers from QuickLogic giving an overview of the ETH Zurich "Arnold" test chip and the path to production for the CORE-V MCU SoC, as well as Global Foundries talking about the features and benefits of 22FDX. You will also hear from the ARC Investment VC fund with insights into why there is early investment in open-source activity and as always, the popular Q&A at the end with the panel.
