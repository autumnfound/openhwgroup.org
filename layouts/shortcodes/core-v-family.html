        <p>CORE-V is a series of RISC-V based open-source cores with
          associated processor subsystem IP, tools and software for
          electronic system designers. The CORE-V family provides
          quality core IP in line with industry best practices in both
          silicon and FPGA optimized implementations. These cores can be
          used to facilitate rapid design innovation and ensure
          effective manufacturability of production SoCs.</p>
